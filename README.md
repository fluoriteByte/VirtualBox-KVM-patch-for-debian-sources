#How to use this! (for now works with 7.0.18)
- enable deb-src for the main repo, should be easy to do using the gui.
- ```sudo apt install devscripts ccache``` (devscripts for building, ccache for speeding up next builds
- ```sudo apt build-dep virtualbox```
- ```sudo apt-mark hold virtualbox virtualbox-qt``` (prevent apt from upgrading it)
- ```mkdir vbox && cd vbox```
- ```apt source virtualbox```
- cd the only folder in there (should be virtualbox-version-dfsg with version being the version apt downloaded)
- ```git init```
- ```git add *```
- ```git add ``` and then tab until it has selected all files left for addin
- ``` git commit -a -m 'init code'```
- insert Thefull.patch into the folder
- ```git apply Thefull.patch```
- ```git add *```
- ```git commit -a -m 'patched code'```
- ignore them warnings, lol
- ```DEBEMAIL='your name <yourname@example.com>'``` (replace with your info or keep it that way, im not your mom)
- ```CC='ccache cc' CXX='cache c++' debuild -us -uc -i -I -j8```
- if it ever fails, do ```debuild -- clean``` before you investigate
